            Your participation in this study is voluntary. You can refuse to
            participate at any time, without having to give a reason, or also
            withdraw your agreement to participate once the study has already
            started. There will be no negative consequences for you if you
            refuse to participate or if you withdraw from this study early.

            <strong>1. What is the purpose of this study?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In this study, we are interested in how people perceive and mentally
            represent spider and spider-related images. In particular, we are
            investigating when spider images will be judged more or less
            similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. What is the procedure of the study?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the beginning, you will fill out a questionnaire to indicate your
            level of spider fear. After that, you will view multiple spider
            images at the same time on your screen and you will be asked to
            judge their similarity. At the end of the procedure, you will be
            asked to provide some additional information on your thought process
            during the task, and to provide feedback on the study (e.g., if you
            had technical issues). The whole study will take you about 30
            minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              3. What are the benefits of participating in the study?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Your participation will provide us with a better understanding of
            spider-related mental representations and may contribute to the
            understanding of spider phobia. It is unlikely that you gain any
            health-related benefits from participating in this study.

              4. What are the possible risks of taking part this study? Could
              participants experience any discomfort or other side effects?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is unlikely that you will experience any side-effects from your
            participation in the study. However, due to the presentation of
            spider stimuli, you may experience some physical and mental arousal
            and discomfort. Therefore, it is recommended to rest after your
            participation in the study has ended.

              participating?
            </strong>

              complaints, unwanted side effects and/or injuries?

          </p>
          <p>
            Should you experience any symptoms of complaints or unwanted side
            effects that occur in the course of the study, please contact the

            Participants are fully anonymized through Prolific's security
            system. Researchers cannot access a participant's identifiable
            information. We will not request any information that may
            potentially deanonymize participants. In addition, Prolific IDs will
            be replaced with an alphanumeric code for the analysis. Your
            anonymous data can be shared with other researchers or stored in an
            online-database. In possible publications of the data collected in
            the course of this study, Prolific IDs will not be mentioned, and it
            will not be possible to draw any conclusions about the participants.
            Participants also have the possibility of deleting their data within
            3 months after their participation in the study, without having to
            provide a reason. Should you wish to do so, please contact us
            through Prolific's internal messaging service.

            The study coordinators provided me with clear and detailed
            information about the objectives, significance and scope of the
            study, as well as about the requirements resulting from my

            information text for participants and the declaration of consent,
            especially section 4 (regarding risks, discomforts or side effects).
            The study coordinators answered all my questions sufficiently and in
            a comprehensible manner. I had enough time to decide whether I would
            like to participate in this study. At the moment, I have no further
            questions.

            I will follow the instructions that are necessary for conducting
            this study. However, I reserve the right to end my voluntary
            participation at any time, without this being to my disadvantage. If
            I want to withdraw from the study, I can do so by contacting the

            If I want my data to be deleted at a later time, I can arrange for
            it by contacting one of the study coordinators through Prolific
